-- Edge devices (item 28), one for each forest region: the Ubuntu VM that collects its sensor
-- nodes' readings over MQTT and sends them on through the edge-com function. Admins add them on
-- the Devices page and can turn one off; a device that's off can't send anything. Its token is in
-- 016_3, on its own, so nobody can read it through the API.
-- Run it after 001 to 015.
-- The SQL editor runs a whole file as one transaction, so if anything in here fails, nothing from
-- it is kept. It's safe to run again.

-- 015 has to be there first, and 001 to 014 before that.
