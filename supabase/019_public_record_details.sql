-- coming back in the order they were saved. Staff still see everything through records_staff.
-- The phone doesn't read this view, so nothing changes for it.
-- Run it after 001 to 017. There's no 018 file.
-- The SQL editor runs a whole file as one transaction, so if anything in here fails, nothing from
-- it is kept. It's safe to run again.
-- supabase/tests/public-details.test.js checks it.

-- don't count, the same as sameName in web/src/lib/review.ts. A species renamed in the SQL editor
-- hides its records until they're corrected, since it's safer to hide too much than too little.
