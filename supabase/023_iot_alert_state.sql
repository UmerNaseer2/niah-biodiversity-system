-- edge-com's working state for alerts, one row per node and condition: how many readings in a row
-- show it (or are back to normal), which alert is open, and when the last one ended. It's only for
-- edge-com, which connects to the database directly, so it has Row Level Security on, no policies,
-- and no grants. Staff read the alerts themselves in iot_alerts.
-- Run it after 022.
-- The SQL editor runs a whole file as one transaction, so if anything in here fails, nothing from
-- it is kept. It's safe to run again.
