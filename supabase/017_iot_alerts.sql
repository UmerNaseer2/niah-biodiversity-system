-- Threat alerts (item 31). edge-com decides them from the readings when an upload arrives, with
-- each node's own settings in iot_nodes: an alert opens after alert_confirm_readings readings in a
-- row show the condition, ends by itself after as many readings in a row are back past the clear
-- threshold (MOTION: motion_clear_readings), and the same condition stays quiet for alert_rearm_s
-- after an end. QUIET (a node that stopped sending) is raised here, by iot_raise_quiet_alerts, so it
-- also works when a whole edge is down. One ongoing problem is one alert, not a new one for every
-- reading. Officers and admins can acknowledge and resolve an alert, and the database writes down
-- who and when.
-- Run it after 016_4.
-- The SQL editor runs a whole file as one transaction, so if anything in here fails, nothing from
-- it is kept. It's safe to run again.

-- 1. The alerts. Nobody adds or changes one directly through the API. edge-com and the functions
-- below do, so a row can't say someone else acknowledged or resolved it. The node's name is kept as
-- well as its ID, and the staff's names as well as their IDs, so an alert still says who it was
-- after an account is deleted.
-- Two kinds of "over": cleared_at is when the readings showed the condition had passed, resolved_at
-- when someone said it's dealt with. Either can come first.
-- urgent could mean someone is at the plant, or a fire or a flash flood. routine (DRY, RAIN) can
-- wait for the next patrol.
-- from_backlog: the alert started more than an hour before it was opened, because its readings
-- came from an edge's buffer after an outage. It's kept for the record but doesn't count as one
-- needing someone.
