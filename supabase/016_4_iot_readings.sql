-- Sensor readings (items 28 and 29). Only edge-com adds them, for nodes an admin has linked to the
-- device that sent them, and nobody changes or removes one through the API. A device can't be
-- removed while it has readings, and neither can a node, so the history stays whole. Turn a device
-- off instead. Officers and admins read them.
-- The values are raw, as the node measured them. Soil % and rain % are worked out when they're
-- read, with the node's calibration in iot_nodes (iot_raw_pct below), so a recalibration also
-- fixes the old readings. Old readings from an edge's buffer are stored like any other, for
-- analysis; only a reading measured more than 5 minutes in the future is turned down (edge-com).
-- Run it after 016_3. 017_1 adds the alerts.
-- The SQL editor runs a whole file as one transaction, so if anything in here fails, nothing from
-- it is kept. It's safe to run again.
