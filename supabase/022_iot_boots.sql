-- Node power-ups. One row each time a node starts: where it's installed (set by hand in its
-- secrets.h and sent once per power-up, as it has no GPS), and the first and last reading that
-- arrived, so you can see whether readings went missing. edge-com fills it in. Nodes sit beside
-- protected plants, so only officers and admins read it, and no public view does.
-- Run it after 017_1.
-- The SQL editor runs a whole file as one transaction, so if anything in here fails, nothing from
-- it is kept. It's safe to run again.
