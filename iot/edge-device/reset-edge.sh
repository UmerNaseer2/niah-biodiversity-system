# Use it when the edge ran an earlier version of this design, or to throw away
# test data. It is NOT part of install-edge.sh and never runs by itself.
#
# Deletes
#   /opt/iot-edge/data/edge.db (+ -wal, -shm): every reading, sent or not, the
#     quick-alert history, positions, commands and calibration copies
# Keeps
#   config.toml, secrets.toml (MQTT passwords, edge key), Mosquitto, the scripts and
#   the services. Readings not yet uploaded to Supabase are LOST.
#   The broker's retained status / position messages are kept on purpose: they
#   describe each thing's current power-up, and a connected thing only sends
#   its boot_id again when it reconnects, so thing-com needs them.
#
# Resetting Supabase (supabase/reset.sql + schema.sql) needs this reset too,
# run after it; then paste the edge registration printed at the end.
